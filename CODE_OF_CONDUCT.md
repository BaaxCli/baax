# Code of Conduct for Baax Project

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of **Baax**, pledge to foster an open, respectful, and harassment-free community. We are building tools to empower developers globally, and we want our community to reflect the same inclusivity and empowerment. Everyone deserves to participate without fear of discrimination or disrespect, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Expected behaviors that build a positive community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what benefits the community as a whole
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Using sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing private information (e.g. addresses, emails) without explicit permission
- Any conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional, collaborative environment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and taking fair, swift action when these standards are breached. This includes the right to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for unacceptable behavior

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces â€” GitHub discussions, issues, PR reviews, and any other official channels. It also extends to public spaces when an individual is representing Baax or its community, such as:

- Using an official Baax email
- Posting via official social media accounts
- Acting as an appointed representative in online or offline events

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately to the Baax team at:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality and will take necessary and appropriate actions. Failure by project maintainers to enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may result in their removal from project leadership roles.
